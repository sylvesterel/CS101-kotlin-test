    // OBS!!! PLEASE NOTE THAT FROM NOW ON:
    // IN ALL EXERCISES WITH CLASSES AND INTERFACES IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT THE ATTRIBUTES IN THE
    //      SAME ORDER AS WRITTEN IN THE EXERCISE DESCRIPTION ELSE IT WILL NOT PASS THE TEST!

    // IN ALL EXERCISES THAT INCLUDES A displayDetails FUNCTION, IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU DISPLAY IT
    // AS LONG AS THE VALUES OF THE VARIABLES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRINTED TEXT.
    // FOR EXAMPLE, displayDetails OUTPUT IN EXERCISE 1 COULD BE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
    // - "the title is CS101 testing, the author Jane Doe, and the price 199.0 DKK"
    // - "title: CS101 testing, author: Jane Doe, price: 199.0"
    // - "CS101 testing, 199.0, Jane Doe"
    // - ETC.

    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 1
    // Create a Book class with 3 attributes: title, author, and price (Double)
    // Add a method to display book details called displayDetails that prints title, author and price

    class Book(
        val title: String,
        val author: String,
        val price: Double
    ) {
        fun displayDetails() {
            println("Title=$title, author=$author, price=$price")
        }
    }

    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 2
    // Create a Student class with the attributes name, age, and grades (a list of integers)
    // The grades variable must not be in the contructor, but instead created inside the class.
    // Add methods to add a grade (addGrade), calculate the average grade (averageGrade as Double),
    // and display student details (displayDetails) which must print name, age and average grade

    class Student(
        val name: String,
        var age: Int,
        val grades: MutableList<Int>,
        var averageGrade: Double = 0.0
    ) {

        fun addGrade(grade: Int) {
            grades.add(grade)
            averageGrade = grades.average()
        }

        fun  displayDetails() {
            println("name=$name, age=$age, averageGrade=$averageGrade")
        }

    }

    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 3
    // Create a BankAccount class with the attributes accountNumber, balance (Double), and accountHolder
    // Add methods to deposit, withdraw, and display account details (displayDetails) which must include accountNumber, balance, and accountHolder
    // Ensure that the balance cannot be negative

    class BankAccount(
        val accountNumber: Int,
        var balance: Double,
        val accountHolder: String
    ) {
        fun deposit(amount: Double) {
            balance += amount
        }

        fun withdraw(amount: Double) {
            balance -= amount
        }

        fun displayDetails() {
            println("accountnumber=$accountNumber, balance=$balance, accountHolder=$accountHolder")
        }
    }


    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 4
    // Create a Product class that includes a name (String) and price (Double)
    // Create a Shop class that contains a list of Product objects called products
    // Add methods to add a product (addProduct), remove a product (removeProduct), and print a list of all the products (listProducts)
    // Include a method to calculate and return the total value of all products in the shop (totalValue)
    // Additionally, create a filterProducts function that takes a minimum price (Double) and returns the products above that price

    class Product(
        val name: String,
        var price: Double
    ){

    }

    class Shop {
        private val products = mutableListOf<Product>()

        fun addProduct(product: Product) {
            products.add(product)
        }

        fun removeProduct(product: Product) {
            products.remove(product)
        }

        fun listProducts() {
            if (products.isEmpty()) {
                println("No products in shop.")
            } else {
                products.forEach { println(it) }
            }
        }

        fun totalValue(): Double = products.sumOf { it.price }

        fun filterProducts(minPrice: Double): List<Product> {
            return products.filter { it.price > minPrice }
        }
